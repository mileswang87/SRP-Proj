    <p>A wiki (Listeni/ˈwɪki/ wik-ee) is usually a web application which allows people to add, modify, or delete content
        in
        a collaboration with others. Text is usually written using a simplified markup language or a rich-text
        editor.[1][2]
        While a wiki is a type of content management system, it differs from a blog or most other such systems in that
        the
        content is created without any defined owner or leader, and wikis have little implicit structure, allowing
        structure
        to emerge according to the needs of the users.[2]</p>

    <p>The encyclopedia project Wikipedia is the most famous wiki on the public web, but there are many sites running
        many
        different kinds of wiki software. Wikis can serve many different purposes both public and private, including
        knowledge management, notetaking, community websites and intranets. Some permit control over different functions
        (levels of access). For example, editing rights may permit changing, adding or removing material. Others may
        permit
        access without enforcing access control. Other rules may also be imposed to organize content.</p>
